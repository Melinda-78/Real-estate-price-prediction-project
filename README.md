Real Estate Price Prediction Project
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a real estate price prediction data science project. 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of real estate properties based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
This predictive model can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market to make informed decisions.

Key Features
Data collection: Scraping real estate listings from online platforms or using public datasets.
Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights into the relationships between features and target variable (prices).
Model selection: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., to find the best-performing model.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, etc.
Deployment: Building a web application or API for users to input property details and get price predictions.
